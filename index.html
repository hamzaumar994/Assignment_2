    <b>Economic indicators</b>, as the name implies, are statistics that are utilised to acquire a more accurate image of the current state of the economy. The <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b>,the <b>Unemployment Rate</b>, <b>Trade and Globalisation</b> are a few relevant examples. Economic indicators, as well as their interpretation by competent sources, are critical in predicting how the economy will shape out in the next years.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
    These forecasts, in turn, will enable both consumers and businesses to make educated decisions about their future financial plans, such as where and how much capital to invest, whether to expand or reduce their workforce, whether to purchase property, and so on.

    The <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b> is a common statistic used by countries around the world to assess how well they are doing economically. GDP is a measure of the income generated by the production of goods and services through time. The GDP of a country is frequently used as an indicator of living standards and to assess economic health, whether the economy is rising or in a recession.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left"> 
    In 2020, the COVID-19 virus expanded at an alarming rate, infecting millions and bringing economic activity to a halt as countries enacted harsh mobility restrictions to halt the infection's spread. 
    The economic harm is already visible as the health and human toll rises, and it constitutes the world's worst economic shock in decades. The map below depicts the GDP per capita in 2020, while the area chart depicts the change in GDP per capita over the last ten years. 
    The virus has affected practically every country's GDP rate, and a 5.2 percent reduction in the global GDP rate is projected in 2020. Despite unprecedented attempts by governments to combat the downturn with fiscal and monetary policy support, it is regarded as the biggest global recession in decades.

    <b>Unemployment</b> refers to those who are employable and actively looking for work but are unable to find work. It is a crucial macroeconomic indicator. 
    The level of unemployment reflects how well our economy is doing. Unemployment indicates that we are not utilising our workforce efficiently, and as a result, we are not generating as many goods and services as we could. Unemployment has a personal cost as well. 
    Regardless of how good things are going for the typical citizen, those without work, and thus income, will be in a worse situation.

    <b>Trade openness (as a share of GDP)</b> refers to a country's economic orientation in the context of international trade. The actual size of an economy's registered imports and exports is used to determine its degree of openness. 
    Trading openness is a measure of how open or closed a country's trade relations are with the rest of the world. It is viewed as a means of boosting economic development in a developing country.</p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
    Openness is a critical enabler of growth, job creation, and poverty alleviation. Trade opens up new market opportunities for domestic enterprises, boosts productivity, and encourages innovation through competition.
    This, in turn, will have an impact on GDP and other economic indicators. </p>

    However, the bubble plot shows that trade openness has a detrimental effect on growth in countries with low financial development, such as <strong style='color: #377eb8'>Burundi</strong>, and seems to have minimal effect in nations with high financial development, such as <strong style='color: #006d2c'>Australia</strong>, <strong style='color: #de2d26'>Switzerland</strong>, and others.

<p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
    <strong style='color: #de2d26'>Luxembourg's</strong> economy is heavily reliant on the banking, steel, and manufacturing industries. In 2018, <strong style='color: #de2d26'>Luxembourg</strong> had the world's second highest per capita GDP and the world's highest trade openness. 
    Similarly, countries such as <strong style='color: #ff7f00'>Singapore</strong> and <strong style='color: #ff7f00'>Hong Kong</strong> have high trade openness rates and GDP per capita due to advanced technical infrastructure, skilled workforce availability, favourable immigration policies, and the flexibility with which new enterprises can be established. 
    Furthermore, <strong style='color: #ff7f00'>Macao</strong> is one of the world's richest places due to its small population and land area, tax haven status, and port with no foreign exchange control regimes.

        The <b>Child Mortality Rate</b>, also known as the under-five mortality rate, is the likelihood of dying between birth and the age of five, expressed per 1,000 live births. Researchers believe that recessions have a negative impact on maternal and baby outcomes, especially in the early phases of a country's development, however the impacts vary greatly across different systems. 
        The challenge for today's policy makers is the design and implementation of mechanisms that protect vulnerable populations from the effects of fluctuating national income.
</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left"> 
        <b>Urbanisation</b> and economic growth are inevitably linked, however the impacts from this can be both negative and positive. Economic growth normally implies a process where rural land is converted to urban uses, such as industrial, residential, and commercial, this is a transition from agrarian-based economy to a more urban economy based on services and industry.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
        <b>Life satisfaction</b> is often reported on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum level of happiness attainable. This is known as the 'Cantril Ladder'. At fixed points in time, there is a high association between income and happiness between and within countries. It has been demonstrated that as countries become wealthier, their populations report higher levels of average life satisfaction, and vice versa.</p>
